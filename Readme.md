This is an attempt at a playstation version of the cube wave by bees and bombs.

The inspiration comes from Daniel Shiffman.

His version is in P5 or processing (one of those), and he has access to a "box" class, so 
the challenge for me will be to make such a class, as well as backface culling (and possibly occlusion culling).
